				<h3>Our Story</h3>
				<div id="space"></div>
				<h4>Combining Comfort Food and Fine Mexican Cuisine</h4>
				<p class="bodyText">Founder and head chef Mike Fahrbach has always aspired to share meals with fellow friends and family, and provide the best food amongst every meal. His love for both comfort and Mexican cooking inspired him to branch out and take his home cooking to the public.</p>
				<div id="space"></div>
			
				<p class="bodyText">With the last name Fahrbach, Mike's friends created the nickname "FahrBQ" once he started to smoke various meats. Regardless that the name started off as a joke, it stuck and became the driving inspiration for him to open up a breakfast and lunch shop.</p>
